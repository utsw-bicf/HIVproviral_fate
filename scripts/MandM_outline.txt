Outline of the materials and methods for HIV project

1) DNAse-seq
Fastq files ENCFF001DPG and ENCFF001DPF was downloaded from the ENCODE project. Files were processed with an in-house pipeline. Briefly, we used trimgalore version 0.4.1 (Martin, 2011) on the raw reads to remove reads shorter than 35bp or with phred quality scores less than 20 and then aligned trimmed reads to the human reference genome (GRCh38) using default parameters in BWA samse version 0.7.12 (Li and Durbin, 2009). The aligned reads were subsequently filtered for quality and uniquely mappable reads were retained for further analysis using Samtools version 1.3 (Li et al., 2009) and Sambamba version 0.6.6 (Tarasov et al., 2015). Relaxed peaks were called using MACS version 2.1.0 (Zhang et al., 2008) with the following parameters: -p 1e-2 --nomodel --shift -100 --extsize 200 --keep-dup all -B --SPMR. Peaks that overlap at least 50% between replicates were retained.

2) MNase-seq

Files were processed with an in-house pipeline. Briefly, we used trimgalore version 0.4.1 (Martin, 2011) on the raw reads to remove reads shorter than 35bp or with phred quality scores less than 20 and then aligned trimmed reads to the human reference genome (GRCh38) using default parameters in BWA sampe version 0.7.12 (Li and Durbin, 2009). The aligned reads were subsequently filtered for quality and uniquely mappable reads were retained for further analysis using Samtools version 1.3 (Li et al., 2009) and Sambamba version 0.6.6 (Tarasov et al., 2015), and bedtools version 2.26.0 (Quinlan and Hall, 2010) bamtobed converted the bed file to tagalign. Peaks were called with iNPS version 1.2.2 (reference???)
