Hi All,

Thanks for meeting with us last week. We are attaching the finalized table of NGS data sets for the short-term (2-month) project. The data sets were classified based on different features:

1) Chromatin accessibility (DNase-seq, MNase-seq)
2) Epigenetics (ChIP-seq)
3) Transcription factor/activity (ChIP-seq)
4) Expression of human genomic domains (RNA-seq, TT-seq, 4sU-seq)
5) Chromatin organization (HiC, DamID-seq and CTCF ChIP-seq)
6) HIV integration - expression (HIV integration map, DNA barcodes, RNA barcodes)

Please note that only a subset of these datasets are loaded in BioHPC.

Let us now if we should meet again this week or early Jan 2019 to discuss this further and come up with a plan of action.

Thanks!
Ivan-
